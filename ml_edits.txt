## Make new branch

git checkout -b maria

## Add text in step 4(c) to Group_Project.md

nano Group_Project.md
cat Group_Project.md

## Push changes to "maria" branch

git add .
git commit -m  "added text to Group_Project.md as specified in step 4(c) of Project 1"
git push --set-upstream origin maria

## merged "maria" changes to "main" on GitHub, and then merged "main" back to "maria" to follow project steps even though they're exactly the same. Wasn't sure if intended to make sure everyone got to merge?

## Add degree program, make new commands file (steps 4c and 4d)

warning: Pulling without specifying how to reconcile divergent branches is
discouraged. You can squelch this message by running one of the following
commands sometime before your next pull:

  git config pull.rebase false  # merge (the default strategy)
  git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
  git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only

You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
invocation.

Already up to date.
